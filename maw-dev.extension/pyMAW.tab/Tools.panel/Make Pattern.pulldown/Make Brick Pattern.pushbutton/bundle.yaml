    Generate brick and tile patterns and filled region types for custom
    brick sizes.

    Select the brick or tile pattern, enter the desired dimensions and
    this tool will create the desired pattern and filled region. Patterns and
    filled regions will be named in a standard format.


    TIP: There are patterns with double lines for the mortar/grout, and single
    line versions, both take the mortar/grout width into consideration so the
    single line versions will match the double line ones accurately.
